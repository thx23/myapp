we need to automate the population of src_main's 
accordions with exercises from the exercises folder.

I think I know how we'd do this in php, but we should figure out what 
the approach is here.

this might be sub-folder intensive (and would need to be scrapped down the line)
but one possibility is:

	exercises/[exercise_type]/[specific_exercise]

folder structure, and then within [specific_exercise] we'd put
thumb.jpeg, basic_info.txt, [specific_exercise].html 
and then populate the accordions in src_main from there...
