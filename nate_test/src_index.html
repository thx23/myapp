									Your torso and the legs should make a

									the quadriceps go back to the starting position as 
									you exhale.

									Proper Bench Press form starts lying on a Bench with 
									your feet on the floor. Un-rack the bar with straight 
									arms. Lower it to your mid-chest. Press it back up 
									until you have locked your elbows. Keep your butt on 
									the bench. The Bench Press is a full body, 
									compound exercise. It works your chest, shoulders 
									and triceps most.To avoid shoulder pain, tuck your 
									elbows 75° when you lower the bar. Don’t try to stretch 
									your chest by flaring your elbows 90° out. You’ll 
									impinge your shoulders if your upper-arms are 
									perpendicular to your torso at the bottom. 
									Tuck your elbows 75° to Bench Press pain-free.
									Unlike the Squat or Deadlift, the bar doesn’t move 
									in a vertical line when you Bench Press with proper 
									form. It moves diagonally from your mid-chest over 
									your shoulders. This is the safest way to Bench Press 
									for your shoulders.

									Start by placing a barbell that is about chest high 
									on a squat rack. Once you have selected the weights, 
									grab the barbell using a pronated (palms facing forward) 
									grip. Make sure to grip the bar wider than shoulder 
									width apart from each other. Then, slightly bend the 
									knees and place the barbell on your collar bone. 
									Lift the barbell up keeping it lying on your chest. 
									Take a step back and position your feet shoulder 
									width apart from each other. Once you pick up the 
									barbell with the correct grip length, lift the bar 
									up over your head by locking your arms. Hold at about 
									shoulder level and slightly in front of your head. 
									This is your starting position. Lower the bar down 
									to the collarbone slowly as you inhale. Lift the bar 
									back up to the starting position as you exhale. Repeat 
									for the recommended amount of repetitions.

									First, choose a flat bench and place a dumbbell on 
									each side of it. Next, Place the right leg on top of 
									the end of the bench, bend your torso forward from the 
									waist until your upper body is parallel to the floor, 
									and place your right hand on the other end of the bench 
									for support. Use the left hand to pick up the dumbbell 
									on the floor and hold the weight while keeping your 
									lower back straight. The palm of the hand should be 
									facing your torso. This will be your starting position.
									Pull the resistance straight up to the side of your 
									chest, keeping your upper arm close to your side and 
									keeping the torso stationary. Breathe out as you 
									perform this step. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing 
									the back muscles once you reach the full contracted 
									position. Also, make sure that the force is performed 
									with the back muscles and not the arms. Finally, the 
									upper torso should remain stationary and only the arms 
									should move. The forearms should do no other work 
									except for holding the dumbbell; therefore do not try 
									to pull the dumbbell up using the forearms. Lower the 
									resistance straight down to the starting position. 
									Breathe in as you perform this step. Repeat the 
									movement for the specified amount of repetitions. 
									Switch sides and repeat again with the other arm.

								  Lat is a shortened word for a muscle in your mid back 
								  called the latissimus dorsi. The latissimus is the 
								  broadest muscle in your back, spanning from the bottom 
								  of your shoulder blades to about an inch or so above your 
								  hips. This muscle is the target for these pull-downs. 
								  The lat muscle is what draws the arm backwards and 
								  downwards, also rotating the front of the arm towards 
								  the body. This action helps when reaching for objects 
								  as well as lifting them. It also aids in pushing and 
								  pulling doors. Remember when using a machine; adjust 
								  the weight to a comfortable level for you. 
								  Stay hydrated through all workouts. 
								  How to: Sit at a lat pull-down station and grab the bar 
								  with an overhand grip that's just beyond shoulder width. 
								  Your arms should be completely straight and your torso 
								  upright. Pull your shoulder blades down and back, and 
								  bring the bar to your chest. Pause, then slowly return 
								  to the starting position.

									First, Lie flat on your back with your feet flat on 
									the ground, or resting on a bench with your knees bent 
									at a 90 degree angle. If you are resting your feet on 
									a bench, place them three to four inches apart and 
									point your toes inward so they touch. Now place your 
									hands lightly on either side of your head keeping your 
									elbows in. Tip: Don't lock your fingers behind your 
									head. While pushing the small of your back down in the 
									floor to better isolate your abdominal muscles, begin 
									to roll your shoulders off the floor. Continue to push 
									down as hard as you can with your lower back as you 
									contract your abdominals and exhale. Your shoulders 
									should come up off the floor only about four inches, 
									and your lower back should remain on the floor. At the 
									top of the movement, contract your abdominals hard and 
									keep the contraction for a second. Tip: Focus on slow, 
									controlled movement - don't cheat yourself by using 
									momentum. After the one second contraction, begin to 
									come down slowly again to the starting position 
									as you inhale. Repeat for the recommended amount of 
									repetitions.

									Lie flat on the floor (or exercise mat) on your back
